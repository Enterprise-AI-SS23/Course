    "In this assignment, you will get to practice using [TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/analyzing-and-validating-data-at-scale-for-ml-using-tfx), an open-source Python package from the [TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) ecosystem. \n",
    "\n",
    "TFDV helps to understand, validate, and monitor production machine learning data at scale. It provides insight into some key questions in the data analysis process such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the underlying statistics of my data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What does my training dataset look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does my evaluation and serving datasets compare to the training dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can I find and fix data anomalies?\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below summarizes the usual TFDV workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://i.imgur.com/BtkrYQV.png' alt='picture of tfdv workflow'>\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown, you can use TFDV to compute descriptive statistics of the training data and generate a schema. You can then validate new datasets (e.g. the serving dataset from your customers) against this schema to detect and fix anomalies. This helps prevent the different types of skew. That way, you can be confident that your model is training on or predicting data that is consistent with the expected feature types and distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use TFDV in order to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate and visualize statistics from a dataframe\n",
    "* Infer a dataset schema\n",
    "* Calculate, visualize and fix anomalies\n",

    "### Exercise 4: Compare Training and Evaluation Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are going to generate the evaluation statistics and compare it with training statistics. You can use the [`tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/api_docs/python/tfdv/generate_statistics_from_dataframe) function for this. But this time, you'll need to pass the **evaluation data**. For the `stats_options` parameter, the list you used before works here too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that to visualize the evaluation statistics you can use [`tfdv.visualize_statistics()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/api_docs/python/tfdv/visualize_statistics). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is impractical to visualize both statistics separately and do your comparison from there. Fortunately, TFDV has got this covered. You can use the `visualize_statistics` function and pass additional parameters to overlay the statistics from both datasets (referenced as left-hand side and right-hand side statistics). Let's see what these parameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lhs_statistics`: Required parameter. Expects an instance of `DatasetFeatureStatisticsList `.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rhs_statistics`: Expects an instance of `DatasetFeatureStatisticsList ` to compare with `lhs_statistics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lhs_name`: Name of the `lhs_statistics` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rhs_name`: Name of the `rhs_statistics` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this case, remember to define the `lhs_statistics` protocol with the `eval_stats`, and the optional `rhs_statistics` protocol with the `train_stats`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, check the function for the protocol name declaration, and define the lhs and rhs names as `'EVAL_DATASET'` and `'TRAIN_DATASET'` respectively."
